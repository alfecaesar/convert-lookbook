# Shopify Lookbook

Shopify Lookbook implementation using React, Shopify Liquid, Metaobjects and Storefront API.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

The React bundle will be generated in the Shopify theme `assets` folder.

## Shopify

Create a `lookbook` metaobject with:

* Title

The product page section automatically shows the Lookbooks containing the current product.
